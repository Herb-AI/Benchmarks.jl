# PBE BV Track 2018 

Bit-manipulation example from the SyGuS Challenge 2018 using programming by example. Inputs and outputs (see `data.jl`) are hexa-decimal bitvalues which need to be reached via a sequence of bit-operations (see `grammars.jl`).

Problems and their corresponding grammars share the same suffix.
